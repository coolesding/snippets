# snippets
dont repost my content, you dont have the right to and i will take action against it

css snippets i make for discord, supported for vesktop, may work on other clients


if you want to and have no life you can make an issue or pull request and write a proper, cool readme for this (i just dont feel like doing onekocord all over again [even though it is very cool!])
